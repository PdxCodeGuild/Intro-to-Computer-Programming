### For Students
As a student here, you will have access to this material. I intend to walk through the material, likely straying from each days preparations, and end each class with a print out.

1. If you are confused, let me know.
2. If you are unsure if something I am typing is functionally critical, ask.
3. If your work environment behaves differently, ask.
4. If I use a term you do not recognize, ask.

There exists a copy of this material online, feel free to enjoy it.

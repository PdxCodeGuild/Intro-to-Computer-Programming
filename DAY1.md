# Day 1 - Setup Environment, Shell, Basic Programming, First Exercise
## Setup Environment
1. [Atom](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/atom.md) and [Tricks](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/atom-python.md)
2. [Python](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/py.md)

## Shell

Developers often favor CLI due to the ease of automating repetative tasks. We will to look at [Powershell/Bash](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/cli.md) and how it compares to your GUI.

# Day 1 - Setup Environment, Shell, Basic Programming, First Exercise
## Setup Environment
1. [Atom](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/atom.md) and [Tricks](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/atom-python.md)
2. [Python](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/py.md)

## Shell
A shell is another way for you to interact with your computer. This is often a CLI (Command Line Interface) as apposed to a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Developers often favor CLI due to the ease of automating repetative tasks. We will to look at [Powershell/Bash](https://github.com/selassid/codeguild/blob/master/notes/cli.md) and how it compares to your GUI.

## Python
How to make a python file, and establishing a workflow.

### Variables
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# assignment
x = 'cat'
print(x)

# reasignment
x = 'dog'
print(x)

x = 'cat'
x = 'dog'
print(x)

# multiple variables
y = 'cat'
print(x, y)

# What do you think this does?
x, y = y, x
print(x, y)
```

### Using Strings
### print()
### String concatenation
### String method .format()
### Input()
### Have the students make a [Madlib](./example-files/madlib.py)

# More on Modules
We firts identify a tast, then we search for a package that provides that facility. In this instance, we are in needs of random names of people for our *Simplified Blackjack*.

### Finding a Module
For today's class, I needed a way to generate names of game players. Lets see if someone else has done it!

```
https://pypi.python.org/pypi
```

### Audit the code
Although it isn't common practice for small projects, industry projects often have an auditing process. This is a small enough module for us to audit during class. 

### Installing **names**
Please do not use `sudo`. It is dangerous to install packages with the `sudo` command on your system.

```
$ pip install --user names
```

# Review on whiteboard the current content

We will review the material at a high level, and write the operations we have explored thus far. Open for questions.

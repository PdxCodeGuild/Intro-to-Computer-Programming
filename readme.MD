# Introduction to Computer Programming

## Overall Goals
1.	Give attendees a basic foundation to launch their learning journey (ex. Setting up environment)
2.	Vet students who have applied to bootcamp
3.	Create an opportunity for students to decide if programming is for them
4.	Market Code Guild

## Day 1
 - Get right version of python installed
 - Get atom installed
 - Teach basic command line (Most students will have never used or seen Bash/PowerShell)
 - Python
    * Variables
    * Strings
    * print()

# Day 2
 - Other Data Types
    * Integers, Floats, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries
 - Loops
    * for
    * while
 - Conditional Logic/Booleans
 - Boolean quiz at https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=670F7823653E09D7!8635&authkey=!ANnvITc1d7TZ4Ag&ithint=file%2cpy
 - I usually have students make a program that will sort things from a list into other lists depending on the datatype or something along those lines

# Day 3
 - Functions
 - Review dictionary methods
 - Phone book challenge – Have students make a phonebook program that will give the user a menu and have the capability to search, add, change and remove entries.

# Day 4
 - Python Modules
    * Pip

# Day 5
 - Classes
 - I usually use the bank account example at http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/object_oriented_programming.html
 - Have students rewrite the phonebook as a class

# Day 6
 - I normally don’t have anything set for day 6 because the other days will eat into this.
